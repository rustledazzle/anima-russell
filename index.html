        The Speaker discussed the data privacy act, which is Republic Act No. 10173, 
        meaning we have rights about our personal data or our personal information. From what I remembered, 
        from the moment we were born in this world, with at least twenty-four hours, the new-born baby must have 
        registered information, and that’s when the department will proceed with the registries. This is where our 
        first personal information is. The speaker also stated that, with no law, we cannot survive in this world. 
        Personally, for me, I have a part to agree and to disagree, but the most superior decision to me is to 
        agree with it since I analyzed for a quick time that without law there is no peace. 
        """
        
        paragraph2 = """
        It also stated that when a person does do a crime, they will always be accountable. There is offense about 
        that on what punishment will get. Besides that, our personal information is the sensitive data that must not 
        be shared with everyone since it can be used against you, like identity theft. I heard this Data Privacy Act, 
        but I always disregard it and don’t get its importance, but this is crucial for people to be aware of what our 
        place or surroundings are.
        """

        paragraph3 = """
        They also said that, when you feel threatened about your safety, you can always file a complaint, but when you 
        file a complaint, you should also be aware of the need or step you should take; otherwise, they cannot proceed 
        with the conflict about the complaint you have taken. About the awareness on the internet, we should always be 
        knowledgeable, but not always one but also aware, as to think before you click. There are different people on 
        the internet, and you cannot always be on the safe side, as you can be a victim if you are not aware of the things 
        going on in the internet.
        """
        paragraph4 = """
        Protect your account as secure as possible, such as by not using the same password on different platforms. You can 
        decide if you want some third-party application, such as password manager, but for me, I cannot use that as I decided 
        to write on my personal notebook and keep it safe and hidden. For social media platforms, or the important one is Google, 
        this has the information you have, such as personal identity. I cannot say that Google is a hundred percent safe, but you 
        can trust that since it is secure if you use it on your own personal device.
        """
        paragraph5= """
        They have this authentication system, which is helpful to be secured for the account. From the way back in 2020, I 
        could always create a new Google account for a dummy account for my games, but when I tried to create another account 
        just this past month, it looked like I could not create a dummy account from Google as they are now secured, and I observed 
        that I cannot log out of my personal or the original account I have since they changed the system. I didn’t say that it 
        was bad, but for the personal account, it is really secure now.
        """
        paragraph6 = """
        As for the campaign, what I remembered is that "the internet is not safe."  I agree with that, but I will add a saying 
        as “the internet is not safe if you are not aware of what is happening in your virtual surroundings."
